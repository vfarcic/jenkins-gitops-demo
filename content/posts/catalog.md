Unlike my other books and courses where I typically dive into a single tool or a single process, this time, I chose a different approach. Instead of going to great lengths trying to help someone become proficient in one thing, this time, I am trying to give you a quick introduction into many different tools and processes. We will skip the potentially lengthy discussions and in-depth exercises. What I want, this time, is to help you make decisions. Which tool works the best for a given task? What should we explore in more depth, and what is a waste of time? The goal is not to learn everything about a tool in detail but rather to dive into many concepts and a plethora of tools right away. The aim is to get you up-to-speed fast while producing useful "real world" results. Think of each chapter as a crash-course into something with the outcome that you can use right away.

I will assume that you don't have time to read hundreds of pages to learn something that you are not even sure is useful. Instead, I will guess that you got up to one hour to read a summary, and then decide if a tool is worthwhile a more significant investment.

This is a catalog of the tools, and the processes I believe are useful in this day and age. I will try to transfer what I think works well and what might have been the right choice in the past but is not optimal anymore.

Nevertheless, even if the scope of this book/course is different than others, some things are still the same. This is not a book/course with lots of theory. Sure, there will be some text you might need to read, but most of the content consists of hands-on exercises. I always believed that the best way to learn something is through practice, and I am not giving up on that. This is a book/course full of real-world hands-on examples, and each chapter will let you dive into a different tool or a process. At the end of each, you will be able to say, "now I know what this is about, and now I can make a decision whether it is a worthwhile investment."

Think of this book/course as a catalog, combined with patterns and blueprints.
