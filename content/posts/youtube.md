## [DevOps Toolkit](https://youtube.com/c/devopstoolkit)

[![](/img/youtube-small.png#floatright)](https://youtube.com/c/devopstoolkit)

We started the [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/devopstoolkit) out of desire to help others learn the tools and the processes that we should be using and applying in our day-to-day jobs.

We want to help you make decisions. What works well, what doesn't work, why you should choose one tool over the other, and how to get up-to-speed quickly. Which tool works the best for a given task? What should we explore in more depth, and what is a waste of time?

This channel has DevOps in the name because we believe that the only way forward is to combine different types of expertise. Ultimately, we need to be able to develop, test, deploy, and operate our systems without friction caused by silos formed around distinct types of expertise. Hence, our focus is on bridging the gap by focusing on the topics that allow developers, operators, and everyone else works together by adopting tools and processes that are relevant today and foster collaboration.
